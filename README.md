# Starbucks API

An imaginary API to order coffee from Starbucks.

This is a fun project to study RESTful principles and in particular Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS). All the code is directly inspired by this very interesting article: https://www.infoq.com/articles/webber-rest-workflow.
